#
# As you read this, bear in mind that this controller
# is involved in a polymorphic relationship and should
# *never* appear directly in a route.
#
# Create subclasses that know how to deal with the
# specifics of the relationship between the Asset and
# its polymorhpic 'attachable' (see UserAssetsController).
#
# Another option would be to put all of this stuff into a
# module that the polymorphs would include().  However
# doing it this way means we just have one set of templates
# under app/views/assets that are re-used by the polymorphs.
# See self.controller_path in UserAssetsController.
