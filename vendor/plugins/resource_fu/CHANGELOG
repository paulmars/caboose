* Changing how you delegate url helpers

* April 9th, 2007
* Added in the 2 remaining features for polymorphic resources, pretty much
* exactly as I've used them before - as in, they haven't been prettied up 
* or refactored in any way.  As such, they are subject to change and should
* not be relied upon.  
* This commit is mostly to solicit comments and get input on what the 
* DSL should look like for describing url helper delegation.
